# Ksana
Header for Measuring runtime of a Function


## usecase

```cpp
xe::Ksana x{};
// somefunction run in between 
std::cout << '\n' << x.elapsed();
```
Will print how much time it took to execute that function in Millisecond (ms) , it's not precise cuz , it takes time to print the result `std::cout` , use Windows API to directly ouput results to Terminal. 


## What does `Ksana` means ?

क्षण (Kṣaṇa) - Refers to a moment or an instant.

Cool name , aye.
